# Collaboration in Agent-Oriented TypeScript Projects

## 1. Code Reviews

- Review for agent autonomy, clear interfaces, and communication protocols.

## 2. Documentation

- Keep agent behaviors and protocols documented.
- Update markdown files as agents evolve.

## 3. Branching Strategy

- Use feature branches for new agents or protocols.
- Merge via pull requests with peer review.

## 4. Communication

- Discuss agent interactions and environment changes in issues or discussions.

## 5. Knowledge Sharing

- Hold regular syncs to align on agent behaviors and system goals.
